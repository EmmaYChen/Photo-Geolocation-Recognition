The code for our AlexNet model is based on the "convertedAlexNet.py" (obtained by converting AlexNet-places365 caffe model) and the starter code provided by the CS230 teaching team. We modified the following files and commented accordingly:

1. training.py
2. params.json
3. model_fn
4. build_dataset.py
5. train.py
